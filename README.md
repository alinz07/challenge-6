## **Purpose**
To create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

<br/>

## **Challenge Criteria**
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule</br>

* WHEN I open the planner</br>
 THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

* WHEN I scroll down</br>
 THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day</br>
THEN I am presented with another question

* WHEN I click into a time block</br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

* WHEN I click the save button for that time block</br>
THEN the game is over

* WHEN I refresh the page</br>
THEN I can save my initials and score

<br/>

## **How and Why**
I used bootstrap, font awesome, and google font apis, as well as jquery and moment.js, all via cdn links. The planner itself is static
HTML, updated dynamically with input elements, whose contents are saved to local storage when you click the save button.

<br/>
<br/>

## **Things I learned**
* I learned how to use insert an icon using font awesome via a cdn link, the moment.js api with a cdn link.

* I earned some good practice with documentation while learning moment.js.

## **What makes this project stand out?**
Using Jquery, css classes are updated dynamically with a setInterval function to not just color code the different hour-rows upon loading the page, but also to update the colors of each row hourly if the browser is left open.
